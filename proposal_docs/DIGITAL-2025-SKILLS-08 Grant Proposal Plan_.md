## **Part I: Strategic Context and Project Vision**

### **The European AI Skills Imperative: Bridging the Gap from Academia to Industry**

The European Union stands at a pivotal moment in its history, defined by the twin objectives of a green transition and a profound digital transformation. Central to this transformation is the ambition, articulated in the Digital Decade policy programme, to establish digital sovereignty and global leadership in a manner that reflects European values. This vision is not merely about technological development but about fostering a human-centric, trustworthy, and ethical approach to Artificial Intelligence (AI). In the global AI race, where Europe's strengths lie in its deep scientific foundations and technological mastery, the ability to translate these assets into widespread economic and societal benefit is paramount. However, this ambition faces a significant and persistent challenge: a critical skills gap that separates cutting-edge academic research from the practical needs of industry.

This gap is particularly acute for the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) that constitute the backbone of the European economy. While larger organizations may possess the resources to establish dedicated AI research labs and attract top-tier talent, SMEs often struggle to navigate the complexities of digital transformation. Studies consistently show that these enterprises require targeted support to benefit from the opportunities of digitalization while mitigating its inherent risks, such as data security vulnerabilities and the high cost of implementation. The challenge is not a lack of ambition, but a lack of access to tailored, high-quality training that can equip their existing workforce with the specific, advanced digital competencies needed to innovate and compete. The current shortage of skilled professionals in Berlin alone, estimated at 90,000 individuals, underscores the urgency of this issue at a regional level, mirroring a continent-wide dilemma.

Addressing this skills imperative requires more than traditional educational models. It demands a new paradigm of collaboration—one that systematically breaks down the silos between universities, industry, and public bodies. It necessitates the creation of agile, demand-driven educational programs that are co-designed with industry to ensure relevance, co-delivered to foster practical application, and co-certified to guarantee value in the labor market. Without such a concerted effort to cultivate a digitally skilled workforce, particularly within the SME sector, Europe's strategic investments in digital infrastructure risk being underutilized, and its goal of AI leadership will remain unrealized. This proposal directly confronts this challenge, presenting a concrete, scalable, and sustainable solution to build the human capital that will power Europe's digital future.

### **Project AIDA: A Transnational Ecosystem for Advanced AI Talent Development**

In direct response to this European skills imperative, this proposal introduces Project AIDA: the Academic-Industrial Digital Alliance. AIDA is not conceived as a simple training course but as a novel, transnational educational ecosystem designed to systematically fuse academic excellence with industrial pragmatism. Our vision is to create a replicable and sustainable educational model that establishes a dynamic and continuous flow of knowledge, talent, and innovation between Europe's leading universities and its vibrant industrial sector. This ecosystem will produce a new generation of AI-proficient talent, capable of driving innovation within SMEs and harnessing the power of Europe's next-generation digital infrastructure.

The project is built upon a foundation of clear, ambitious, and measurable objectives that collectively address the identified skills gap from multiple angles.

**The High-Level Objectives of Project AIDA are:**

1. **To Develop a World-Class, Industry-Validated Curriculum:** The core of the project is the co-creation of a modular, European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS)-accredited, and industry-certified curriculum in advanced AI applications. This curriculum will be meticulously designed to meet the specific, data-driven needs of SMEs, covering topics from machine learning fundamentals and data-secure systems to ethical AI frameworks and business process automation.  
2. **To Pilot the Curriculum in a "Living Lab" Environment:** The AIDA curriculum will be piloted with a unique dual audience of Master's-level university students and incumbent employees from SMEs. This "Living Lab" will create an unparalleled environment for cross-pollination, where academic theory is immediately tested against real-world problems, and industrial challenges inform academic teaching.  
3. **To Establish a Sustainable Framework for University-Industry Collaboration:** AIDA aims to move beyond ad-hoc partnerships to create a structured and lasting framework for collaboration. By integrating a public certifying body (IHK Berlin) into the consortium, the project will establish a model for dual-branded certification that provides immediate, recognized value in the labor market, forming the basis for a self-sustaining training center post-funding.  
4. **To Actively Foster a Diverse and Inclusive AI Talent Pipeline:** Recognizing that technological excellence is inseparable from diversity, AIDA will embed principles of inclusion throughout its design and implementation. Through targeted outreach, inclusive pedagogy, and dedicated mentorship programs, the project will actively work to broaden the AI talent pool, ensuring that the benefits of the digital transformation are accessible to all.

By framing the project as an "ecosystem," we emphasize its dynamic, interactive, and self-sustaining nature. Unlike a static course, the AIDA ecosystem is designed for growth and adaptation, ensuring its long-term relevance and impact. It represents a systemic solution to a systemic problem, creating a blueprint for how Europe can effectively and sustainably cultivate the advanced digital skills necessary for its future prosperity and sovereignty.

### **Alignment with EU Strategic Priorities: The DIGITAL Europe Programme and AI Factories**

Project AIDA is not a standalone initiative but is strategically designed to be a vital, synergistic component of the European Union's flagship investments in digital infrastructure and skills. Its core mission is to create the human capital necessary to unlock the full potential of these multi-billion-euro investments, particularly the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU) and its network of AI Factories. By aligning directly with these strategic priorities, AIDA offers a compelling return on investment, amplifying the impact of Europe's broader digital strategy.

A central pillar of the EU's plan to bolster AI innovation is the establishment of AI Factories across the continent. These facilities, powered by EuroHPC supercomputers, are designed to give SMEs and researchers access to world-class computing power for developing and training cutting-edge AI models. The success of this initiative hinges on a critical question: who will form the user base with the requisite skills to leverage this powerful infrastructure? Project AIDA provides a direct and concrete answer. Our consortium is geographically and strategically positioned to connect with key German and Italian AI Factories, including facilities in Jülich, Stuttgart, and Bologna. The AIDA curriculum will be explicitly designed to train our dual audience of students and SME employees to become proficient users of these facilities. Modules will incorporate hands-on projects that utilize the "Playground" and "Fast Lane" access modes offered by the AI Factories, which are specifically tailored for entry-level users and SMEs requiring significant GPU hours. By creating a pipeline of skilled users, AIDA directly addresses the primary challenge for these infrastructure hubs: ensuring their resources are fully exploited to drive innovation, particularly within the SME community that the AI Factories are mandated to support.

Furthermore, Project AIDA is designed to be a powerful complement to the **EuroHPC Virtual Training Academy (EVITA)**. EVITA's crucial role is to develop a high-level, standardized European Competence and Qualification Framework (CQF) for HPC and AI, creating a common language for skills across the Union. While EVITA defines the "what" of European AI education, Project AIDA will develop the "how." Our project will create the granular, industry-validated, and pedagogically innovative content and a proven delivery model to implement this framework at a regional level. A key deliverable of AIDA will be a detailed mapping of our modular curriculum onto the EVITA CQF. This contribution will provide the wider EuroHPC community with a valuable, real-world-tested set of learning materials and a pedagogical model that has been proven effective with both academic and industrial learners. This synergy transforms AIDA from a consumer of EU strategy into an active contributor, reinforcing the European educational ecosystem.

This deep alignment demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the EU's strategic landscape. It positions Project AIDA not as just another skills initiative, but as a critical enabler of the EU's largest technological investments. By funding AIDA, the European Commission is not only addressing the immediate skills gap but is also maximizing the return on its €7 billion investment in the EuroHPC JU, ensuring that its world-class supercomputers are matched by a world-class talent pool.

**Activity 4.2 - Program Delivery** will run for two full semesters (Months 22-33). The curriculum will be delivered in a blended format to accommodate both learner groups. HU students will integrate the AIDA modules into their regular M.Sc. coursework, earning ECTS credits. The SME employees will participate through a flexible, part-time model, with a combination of online self-study and intensive, in-person workshops, a model inspired by the successful approach for working professionals at the University of Malta.

A key innovation of the Living Lab is **Activity 4.3 - Industry Integration**. This goes beyond simple instruction to create a true ecosystem of exchange. SME participants will act as mentors for the HU students, providing industry context. In turn, HU students will undertake short-term, project-based internships at the participating SMEs, applying their new skills to solve real problems. IHK Berlin will coordinate a series of guest lectures from senior industry experts. The pilot will culminate in **Capstone Projects**, where mixed teams of students and employees collaborate on a significant, real-world challenge provided by one of the participating SMEs. These projects will be scoped to be ambitious, with a focus on problems that could benefit from the computational power of the German AI Factories, thus preparing participants for future innovation projects. Throughout the pilot,

**Activity 4.4 - Feedback and Iteration** will be paramount, with continuous feedback collected through surveys, focus groups, and direct observation to inform the final, refined version of the curriculum.

**Deliverables:**

* **D4.1 Pilot Participant Cohort Report (Month 22):** A report detailing the demographics and background of the recruited student and SME participants.
* **D4.2 Mid-point Pilot Evaluation Report (Month 27):** An interim report on pilot progress, participant feedback, and initial refinements.

### **Work Package 5: Fostering an Inclusive and Diverse AI Talent Pipeline (Co-Lead: HU Berlin)**

This Work Package embeds the core European value of diversity and inclusion into the very fabric of Project AIDA. Recognizing that excellence and innovation are fueled by a multiplicity of perspectives, this WP moves beyond passive statements of support to implement a concrete, evidence-based action plan to broaden the AI talent pipeline. This WP is co-led by HU Berlin, which will oversee academic inclusion, and IHK Berlin, which will focus on industry-side initiatives.

The primary objective is to ensure that the project actively contributes to increasing the representation of women and other underrepresented groups in the technology sector. This will be achieved through a series of targeted activities. **Activity 5.1 - Targeted Outreach and Recruitment** will involve developing communication materials and campaigns specifically designed to resonate with and attract women and individuals from diverse backgrounds. This includes partnering with established networks and local community organizations to promote the AIDA program.

**Activity 5.2 - Inclusive Curriculum and Pedagogy** will involve a dedicated review of all course materials developed in WP3. This review, guided by best practices in inclusive education, will ensure the use of gender-neutral language, the inclusion of diverse case studies and role models, and the active avoidance of cultural or gender-based stereotypes. Furthermore, all instructors involved in the pilot will participate in a workshop on inclusive teaching practices to foster a welcoming and supportive learning environment for all participants.

**Activity 5.3 - Formal Mentorship Program** will be established to provide structured support. Participants from underrepresented groups will be matched with established industry professionals from the IHK Berlin network. This program will provide not only technical guidance but also career advice and networking opportunities, which are crucial for long-term retention and advancement in the tech field. Finally,

**Activity 5.4 - Bias-Aware Selection** will ensure fairness in the recruitment process for the pilot. The project will implement best practices such as utilizing diverse selection committees, establishing clear and objective evaluation rubrics, and potentially using "blind" reviews of initial applications to minimize the impact of unconscious bias. By dedicating a full Work Package to these activities, AIDA demonstrates a profound and operational commitment to building a more equitable digital future.

**Deliverables:**

* **D5.1 Support and Integration Schemes (Month 6):** Comprehensive support mechanisms for female students and professionals, talented young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, and people with disabilities.

### **Work Package 6: Dissemination, Exploitation, and Long-Term Sustainability (Lead: IHK Berlin)**

This final Work Package is designed to maximize the project's impact far beyond the immediate consortium and to ensure its activities and benefits continue long after the EU funding period concludes. Led by IHK Berlin, whose mission is inherently focused on long-term economic development, WP6 translates the project's outputs into lasting value for Europe.

The objectives are threefold: to disseminate knowledge widely, to exploit the project's results commercially and academically, and to establish a clear path to sustainability. **Dissemination** activities will be guided by a comprehensive plan, targeting multiple audiences through a variety of channels. These will include a professional project website, active social media engagement, publications in high-impact academic journals, presentations at major European AI and education conferences, and the creation of policy briefs for German and EU-level policymakers. Critically, the project will actively utilize official EU channels, including the **Horizon Results Platform** and the **Digital Skills and Jobs Platform**, to maximize visibility and reach within the European R&I community.

**Activity 6.1 - Teach-the-Teacher Training** will develop specialized training modules for university, VET, and secondary education teachers, ensuring the sustainability and scalability of AI education across Europe.

**Activity 6.2 - Communication and Awareness-Raising** will implement comprehensive communication strategies including:

**Exploitation** activities will focus on transforming the project's intellectual assets into tangible, usable products. The primary exploitable result is the **AIDA Certification**, which will be formalized as an official IHK qualification, giving it immediate recognition and value. A comprehensive **Licensing Model** will be developed to allow other universities, vocational schools, and training providers across Europe to adopt and deliver the AIDA curriculum. A key strategic exploitation activity will be the formal packaging of the AIDA curriculum framework and pedagogical model for contribution to the **EVITA consortium**, ensuring our work directly benefits the development of the Europe-wide HPC/AI qualification standard.

The cornerstone of the project's long-term vision is **Sustainability**. This will be achieved through the development of a detailed **Business Plan** for a self-sustaining **"AIDA Training Center."** This center will be structured as a joint venture between HU Berlin and IHK Berlin, leveraging the academic prestige of the university and the industrial reach of the chamber. After the grant period, the center will continue to offer the IHK-certified curriculum and related consulting services to clients on a fee-for-service basis, creating a permanent resource for advanced AI skills development in the Berlin region and a model for replication elsewhere.

## **Part IV: Measuring Success and Maximizing European Impact**

### **Framework for Evaluation: Key Performance Indicators and Impact Metrics**

The success of Project AIDA will be measured not by activity, but by impact. A rigorous, multi-layered evaluation framework will be implemented to track progress and quantify the project's value for participants, industry, and the wider European community. This framework, inspired by established models of training evaluation, moves beyond simple completion rates to assess genuine skill acquisition, behavioral change, and tangible business results. The use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will ensure that our evaluation is data-driven, transparent, and aligned with the project's strategic objectives.

The KPI framework is organized into four key categories, reflecting the project's core goals:

1. **Engagement & Participation (WP4, WP5):** These KPIs measure the reach and attractiveness of the program. We will track the **Course Completion Rate**, with a target of over 85% for both student and SME cohorts, as a primary indicator of learner commitment and course quality.59 Crucially, we will monitor the  
   **Diversity of the participant cohort**, with a specific target of achieving over 40% participation by women and ensuring representation from other underrepresented groups, demonstrating the success of our inclusive outreach in WP5.61 The  
   **SME Engagement Rate**, defined as the number of unique companies participating in capstone projects, internships, or guest lectures, will measure the depth of our industry integration, with a target of over 15 companies.62  
2. **Knowledge & Skill Acquisition (WP4):** These KPIs assess the direct educational effectiveness of the curriculum. The primary metric will be the **Pre- vs. Post-Training Assessment Scores**, where we will conduct baseline and final assessments to measure knowledge gain, targeting an average improvement of over 30%.62 The ultimate measure of success in this category will be the  
   **IHK Certification Pass Rate**, with a target of over 90% of participants who complete the program successfully achieving the formal qualification.59  
3. **Application & Business Impact (WP6):** This category represents the most critical level of evaluation, measuring the real-world application of the acquired skills. Six months after the pilot, we will measure the **Skill Application Rate** through surveys sent to both participants and their direct managers, with a target of over 75% reporting regular, practical use of the new skills in their daily work.62 Through the IHK's trusted relationship with its members, we will also measure  
   **Business Process Improvement**. This KPI will be assessed via a confidential survey to the leadership of participating SMEs, tracking the percentage of firms that report quantifiable improvements such as reduced operational costs, faster time-to-market for new products, or the launch of a new AI-driven service.64 Finally, we will track  
   **Participant Career Progression**, monitoring the percentage of student participants who secure AI-related jobs within six months of graduation and the percentage of SME employees who receive a promotion or are assigned new, AI-related responsibilities within a year.62  
4. **Dissemination & Exploitation (WP6):** These KPIs track the project's influence beyond the immediate consortium. We will measure academic impact through the **Number of publications and conference presentations** (Target: 5+), and public impact through the **Number of downloads of curriculum materials** from the project website (Target: >1,000). The long-term commercial potential will be gauged by the **Number of formal inquiries received for licensing the AIDA model**.

This comprehensive approach, particularly the inclusion of business-impact KPIs facilitated by the IHK partnership, is a key differentiator for Project AIDA. It demonstrates a commitment to measuring and delivering tangible value, moving beyond academic metrics to prove the project's direct contribution to economic competitiveness and innovation.

### **Envisioned Impact: Strengthening Europe's Digital Future**

The successful implementation of Project AIDA will generate a significant and lasting return on the European Union's investment, creating ripples of impact that extend across the economic, societal, and scientific landscapes. This project is architected not merely to train individuals, but to build a self-reinforcing system that strengthens Europe's capacity for innovation and secures its digital future.

The **economic impact** will be direct and measurable. For the participating SMEs, the project will serve as an accelerator for digital maturity, increasing their competitiveness through the adoption of AI-driven efficiencies and the development of new services. For the Berlin region, AIDA will create a more valuable and employable talent pool, directly addressing the documented shortage of skilled workers.5 The graduates of the AIDA program—both students and upskilled employees—will be equipped not only with technical skills but also with the practical, problem-solving mindset required to drive innovation from within their organizations.

The **societal impact** will be equally profound. By embedding a dedicated Work Package for diversity and inclusion, AIDA will make a tangible contribution to creating a more equitable technology sector. The project will provide pathways into high-demand careers for women and individuals from underrepresented backgrounds, fostering social mobility and ensuring the benefits of the digital economy are more broadly shared. Furthermore, by strengthening the linkage between higher education and the regional labor market, the project directly addresses the challenge of youth unemployment, a significant issue in Berlin, by making academic qualifications more directly relevant to employer needs.5

Finally, the **scientific and educational impact** will resonate across Europe. AIDA will produce a new, validated pedagogical model for transnational, industry-integrated technology education. The data gathered from the Berlin Living Lab will provide a rich and unique dataset on the AI skill needs of SMEs and the effectiveness of different training interventions. The project's most strategic contribution, however, will be to the broader European ecosystem. By mapping its validated, modular curriculum to the EuroHPC Virtual Training Academy (EVITA) framework, AIDA will provide a tested, high-quality contribution that can be adopted and adapted by other institutions across the Union, accelerating the development of a harmonized, world-class European AI education landscape.18

In conclusion, a grant awarded to Project AIDA is an investment in far more than a single training program. It is an investment in a strategic blueprint for building the human capital that will power Europe's Digital Decade. It is a catalyst for SME innovation, a vehicle for social inclusion, and a cornerstone for a more integrated and competitive European educational area. We are confident that Project AIDA will deliver exceptional value and create a lasting legacy of excellence and impact.
